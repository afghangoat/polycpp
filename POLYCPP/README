//POLYCPP 1.0 by Afghan Goat//
A fallback library which suits C with some juicy C++ features like namespaces, classes, try catch, errors, iterators, exceptions and templates!

!!!
Important naming convention: the next linked list nodes should be named "next"!
!!!

Missing features:
-Derived class
-Virtual inheritance
-Nested classes and namespaces
-template<>

You need to run the POLYCPP_transpiler.py if you want:
-templates
-::-s
-namespaces
-classes

Usage: add all your source files and their extensions separated by a ' ' (space) and press enter, it will generate *_PCPP.c files for you. 
Your source files must contain an "int main()" segment!!!
